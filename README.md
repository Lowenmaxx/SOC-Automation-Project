# SOC-Automation-Project

## Objective

The primary objective of this SOC automation project is to gain hands-on experience in setting up, configuring, and operating a Security Operations Center in a simulated environment. Gain familiarity with various open-source tools commonly used in real-world SOCs, including Wazuh for alert generation, Shuffle for Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR), and TheHive for case management. This lab aims to simulate cybersecurity incidents to make it possible to practice incident detection, analysis, and response procedures in a controlled setting. This also teaches how to integrate different security tools seamlessly to streamline the incident response process and enhance efficiency. The lab incorporates threat intelligence enrichment capabilities, enabling analysts to enrich Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) using services like VirusTotal.

### Skills Learned

- How to make a network diagram to understand the flow

### Tools Used

- Draw.io: used to make network diagram
- Windows 10 Virtual Machine: Set up a Windows 10 virtual machine to serve as an endpoint for telemetry generation using Sysmon.
- Wazuh Server: Deploy a Wazuh server on a cloud instance to centralize and manage alerts generated by endpoint agents.
- Wazuh Agent: Install the Wazuh agent on the Windows 10 VM to collect telemetry data and forward it to the Wazuh server.
- Shuffle: Implement Shuffle as a SOAR tool to automate response actions based on incoming alerts from Wazuh.
- TheHive: Deploy TheHive for centralized case management, enabling analysts to track and respond effectively to security incidents.
- Mimikatz: to simulate malicious activities on the Windows 10 VM, generating telemetry data captured by Sysmon.

## Steps

#### Diagram
Step 1: Make a network diagram using Draw.io.

#### Install tools

Step 1: Install
<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-VirtualBox-183A61?style=for-the-badge&logo=virtualbox&logoColor=white" /></a> which is needed to make virtual machines (Add which machines later).

Step 2: Install
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Windows%2010-0078D6?style=for-the-badge&logo=Windows&logoColor=white" /></a> media creation tool to make a ISO image.
Step 3: use the ISO file to make a VM using the Windows 10 ISO image

Step 4: Download
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Sysmon-0078D4?style=for-the-badge&logo=Windows&logoColor=white" /></a> and
<a href="https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular/blob/master/sysmonconfig.xml"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Sysmon%20Modular-181717?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white" /></a>

Step 5: Open PowerShell in administrator mode. Use cd (directory here) to change the directory to where you have your unzipped sysmon.

Step 6: Move the sysmonconfig.xml to the same folder as the sysmon folder.

Step 7: use the command .\Sysmon64.exe -i .\sysmonconfig.xml in Powershell to install sysmon.

Step 8: Download<a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Ubuntu%20Desktop-E95420?style=for-the-badge&logo=ubuntu&logoColor=white" /></a> ISO file to make another VM.

Step 9: Follow this guide to install Wazuh <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CfjoCQmpo8"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-YouTube-FF0000?style=for-the-badge&logo=youtube&logoColor=white" /></a>
